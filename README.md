# FLAPPY BIRD
![Gameplay](screenshots/gameplay.png)

## Description
This is a simple game that I made using the Pygame library in Python. The game is a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game. The objective of the game is to navigate the bird through the pipes without hitting them. The bird will fall to the ground if it hits a pipe or the top of the screen. The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or the top of the screen.

This game was made as a fun project to learn more about Neural Network NEAT and Pygame.

## NEAT Algorithm
NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a genetic algorithm that creates artificial neural networks to play the game

## Pygame
Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library. This allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in Python.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone
```
2. Install the required libraries

3. Run the game
