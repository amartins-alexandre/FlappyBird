# FLAPPY BIRD

## Description
This is a simple game that I made using the Pygame library in Python. The game is a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game. The objective of the game is to navigate the bird through the pipes without hitting them. The bird will fall to the ground if it hits a pipe or the top of the screen. The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or the top of the screen. The player can restart the game by pressing the space bar.

## How to Play
1. Run the `flappy_bird.py` file.
2. Press the space bar to start the game.
3. Press the space bar to make the bird jump.
4. Navigate the bird through the pipes without hitting them.
5. The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or the top of the screen.
6. Play the game and have fun!
